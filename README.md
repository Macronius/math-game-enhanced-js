Simple math game, modified from a tutorial math project using JS.

Modification took from only asking multiplication questions to: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and nth-root calculations.

TODO:
- rebuild using React
- style needs work
- increase 'container' to utilize more of the screen
- local storage to track 'score history'
- 'game over' screen with appropriate message, depending on how current score compares to historical
- introduce playstyle adjustment options:
    - difficulty
        - larger numbers
        - fractions
        - decreased time
        - more difficult concepts

(all for the purpose of increasing users intuition for the correct answer, not actually solving for the exact solution)

- could be interesting to have a Tetris style, where the question falls at a certain rate (according to level) and player must adjust its trajectory to land on the correct solution at the bottom.
    NOTE: all rotation action that would otherwise happen to tetriminos in Tetris in fact will occur by the gears in the player's head by grinding out a solution; this absent feature would not diminish the captivation of player.

- introduce periodic random, but inevitable, portals to another dimension of gameplay.  If the other three options are incorrect, then the correct answer must be the artifact from another dimension...[of game play] 
    NOTE: I don't really know what that means

- option to post achievement to facefook


ISSUES:

- every answer selection counts as correct (false sense of good intuition)
